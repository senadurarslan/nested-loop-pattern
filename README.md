# Nested Loop Pattern Generator

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the use of nested loops to generate a specific number pattern.

## Description

The program prints a numerical pattern using two nested `while` loops. The outer loop controls the rows, while the inner loop prints numbers in an increasing order.

### Example Output:
```
1  2  3  4  5
2  3  4  5  6
3  4  5  6  7
4  5  6  7  8
5  6  7  8  9
```
